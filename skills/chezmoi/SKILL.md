`chezmoi apply` deploys source files to `~` and runs `run_onchange` scripts (brew bundle, skill sync, etc.).

LaunchAgents are **not** reloaded automatically. After changing a plist template, apply first, then reload manually:

```sh
# Restart a running agent (picks up plist changes):
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/<label>"

# Full reload (for structural changes like new binary paths):
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/<label>"
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<plist-file>

# Load a new agent for the first time:
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<plist-file>
```

## Notes

- Session transcript data is persisted in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` — sessions survive server restarts
- The opencode-web LaunchAgent has `KeepAlive: true` — the server will always restart after a `kickstart -k`
- **Adding a new `[data]` key to `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` requires `chezmoi init` before `chezmoi apply`** — `apply` alone does not regenerate `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml`
- **`chezmoi init` is destructive to the live config** — it re-renders the template from scratch. The "config file template has changed" warning from `chezmoi apply` is cosmetic when scripts are already deployed; do not run `chezmoi init` to silence it.
- **Machine-specific config lives in `.chezmoidata/local.yaml`** in the source directory — secrets manifest, calendar config, reminders, per-org config. This file is gitignored. Copy `local.yaml.example` from the repo root to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoidata/local.yaml` to get started. The example must NOT live under `.chezmoidata/` itself — files there get merged into `chezmoi data` and would leak placeholder values into runtime.

## Gotchas

- **`.chezmoidata` values are plain data** — template expressions like `{{ .chezmoi.arch }}` inside YAML string values are not evaluated. Arch/OS logic must live in the `.tmpl` file itself.
- **`.app` bundles via `chezmoiexternal`** — use `type = "archive"` with target `"Applications/<AppName>.app"` (unique TOML key per app) and `stripComponents = 1` to strip the archive's root directory. Without `stripComponents = 1` the app ends up double-nested inside the archive's root directory. TOML does not allow duplicate keys, so each app needs its own unique target path.
- **LaunchAgent binary path changes** — after moving a binary (e.g., brew → `~/.local/bin`), `launchctl bootout` + `bootstrap` is required to pick up the new plist; `kickstart` alone is not sufficient if the service is crash-looping.
- **Updating a plist** — apply first to deploy the new file, then `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<label>` to reload.
- **Deleting a managed file** — `chezmoi apply` does not remove files whose source entry was deleted. Use `chezmoi destroy <target>` *before* removing the source entry — it removes both in one step. **Order matters:** if you `git rm` the source first, `chezmoi destroy` returns `not managed` and you must `rm` the deployed file manually. Note: files managed via `.chezmoiexternal.toml.tmpl` cannot be destroyed this way — chezmoi owns them; remove the external entry instead.
- **Deleting a skill** — skills in `skills/` are synced to `~/.agents/skills/` by the `run_onchange_after_sync-and-validate-skills` script, which replaces local skills wholesale. Removing a skill from `skills/` is sufficient — no `chezmoi destroy` needed. External skills (in `packages.skills`) must be removed from the list; they will be gone on the next apply.
- **Empty files are skipped** — chezmoi does not deploy 0-byte files. Python `__init__.py` files need at least a comment (e.g., `# package name`) or they won't appear at the target.
- **"X has changed since chezmoi last wrote it" prompt** — chezmoi's persistent state SHA for that target drifted from the live file (often after an external tool rewrote it, after a template edit between sessions, or after picking `s`kip in a previous prompt). If `chezmoi diff` is empty after the prompt, the live and rendered content actually match — pick `o`verwrite (or rerun with `--force`) to resync state. Picking `s`kip leaves state stale and the prompt will reappear next apply. Recurring offender: `~/.zshrc`, occasionally rewritten by tool installers (bun, mise) at session startup.
- **`__pycache__` under managed lib dirs** — Python bytecache in `~/.local/lib/{kb,cal}/__pycache__/` is generated at runtime and triggers "has changed since chezmoi last wrote it" prompts on every apply. Fix: add `**/__pycache__` to `.chezmoiignore`.
- **Non-TTY "has changed" prompt fails** — when `chezmoi apply` runs from an agent session (no TTY attached), the interactive prompt errors with "could not open a new TTY: open /dev/tty: device not configured". Use `chezmoi apply --force` to skip prompts in non-interactive contexts.
