# Agent Instructions

## Safety

**Confirm before modifying remote services.**

For any remote modification:
1. Show the full proposed content and ask "Do you approve?" - then STOP and wait
2. Only after receiving explicit "yes" or approval, execute the action
3. If no response is possible (background task, automation), do NOT proceed with the modification

This applies to:
- Git: `git push`
- GitHub/GitLab: issues, PRs, comments, **reviews**
- APIs that write/modify data
- Production databases
- Security bypasses: `.talismanrc` ignore rules (`fileignoreconfig`)

**Examples:**
- "Review this PR" → analyze and show review, but do NOT submit to GitHub without approval
- "Commit and push" → show diff and commit message, wait for approval before executing
- Background/automated tasks → analyze and prepare only, never submit

Even if the prompt implies end-to-end completion, always stop before remote modifications. Read-only operations don't require confirmation.

**Never commit globally-ignored files.** Files in `~/.config/git/ignore` are intentionally untracked. Before staging, verify files aren't globally ignored with `git check-ignore <file>`. Key examples: `.talismanrc`, `.opencode/context-log.md`.

## CLI Tools

The following tools are installed via Homebrew and available for use:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
{{- range (include ".chezmoitemplates/Brewfile" | splitList "\n") }}
{{-   if and (hasPrefix "brew " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "brew \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   else if and (hasPrefix "cask " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "cask \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   end }}
{{- end }}

**Prefer these tools** over alternatives when available. For example, use `bat` instead of `cat` for file preview, `jq` for JSON parsing, and `gh` for all GitHub operations.

## Tool Tips

**PTY** (when enabled) - for background processes:
- Send Ctrl+C with `\x03`, Ctrl+D with `\x04`
- Use regex filtering in `pty_read` to find errors: `pattern="error|ERROR"`

**GitHub PR Inline Comments** via `gh api`:
- Use `--input -` with heredoc JSON, not `-f 'comments=[...]'` (gets stringified, not parsed as array)
- Creating a review with comments returns PENDING state; must POST to `/reviews/{id}/events` with `event` to submit
- Line numbers are file lines in HEAD commit, but verify against GitHub's diff display - off-by-one errors are common
- To delete a comment: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id} --method DELETE`

## Development Workflow

**Check in at natural breakpoints.** Complete a logical group of related todos before stopping. Only pause for approval when: (1) the next step is destructive or irreversible, (2) you are genuinely uncertain how to proceed, or (3) you have finished all todos. Do not stop after every single todo — maintain momentum unless a decision is needed. If stuck, ask for help.

**TDD.** Write tests first, then implement. Commit after each green test.

**Before push:**
1. Run tests locally — do not rely on CI as your test runner
2. Review your own changes for bugs, security, and quality
3. Squash into semantic commits (load `semantic-commits` skill for format)
4. Create PRs as draft
5. Ask for approval before pushing (per Safety rules)

**PR reviews vs implementation.** "Review this PR" means: analyze and draft a written review — do NOT implement fixes unless explicitly asked. "Address feedback" or "implement fixes" means: make code changes.

**Scope discipline.** Only change what was asked. Do not refactor adjacent code, update unrelated deps, or add unrequested features. If you notice something worth fixing that is out of scope, mention it but do not change it.

**Research before asking.** Explore the codebase, read files, check git history, query team-context MCP. Only ask the user when information isn't discoverable.

**Architecture decisions:** Present 2-3 options with tradeoffs. Recommend one. Prefer YAGNI, simplicity, and reversibility.

## Task Completion

**Track progress with todos.** Before ending your response:
1. Ensure current work is saved (committed if applicable)
2. Update todo status to reflect actual progress
3. Never abandon work silently—report status and next steps
