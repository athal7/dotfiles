# Agent Instructions

## Safety

**Confirm before modifying remote services.**

For any remote modification:
1. Show the full proposed content and ask "Do you approve?" - then STOP and wait
2. Only after receiving explicit "yes" or approval, execute the action
3. If no response is possible (background task, automation), do NOT proceed with the modification

This applies to:
- Git: `git push`
- GitHub/GitLab: issues, PRs, comments, **reviews**
- APIs that write/modify data
- Production databases
- Security bypasses: `.talismanrc` ignore rules (`fileignoreconfig`)

**Examples:**
- "Review this PR" → analyze and show review, but do NOT submit to GitHub without approval
- "Commit and push" → show diff and commit message, wait for approval before executing
- Background/automated tasks → analyze and prepare only, never submit

Even if the prompt implies end-to-end completion, always stop before remote modifications. Read-only operations don't require confirmation.

## CLI Tools

The following tools are installed via Homebrew and available for use:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
{{- range (include ".chezmoitemplates/Brewfile" | splitList "\n") }}
{{-   if and (hasPrefix "brew " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "brew \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   else if and (hasPrefix "cask " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "cask \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   end }}
{{- end }}

**Prefer these tools** over alternatives when available. For example, use `bat` instead of `cat` for file preview, `jq` for JSON parsing, and `gh` for all GitHub operations.

## Tool Tips

**PTY** (when enabled) - for background processes:
- Send Ctrl+C with `\x03`, Ctrl+D with `\x04`
- Use regex filtering in `pty_read` to find errors: `pattern="error|ERROR"`

## Task Completion

**Never stop with incomplete tasks.** Before ending your response:
1. Check if any todos are marked `in_progress` or `pending`
2. If incomplete todos exist, continue working—do not ask permission
3. Only stop when: all todos are `completed`/`cancelled`, you're genuinely blocked, or you need user input that can't be inferred

## Subagents

Delegate specialized work to these agents:

{{ template "subagent-list" . }}

## Commands

{{ template "command-list" . }}
