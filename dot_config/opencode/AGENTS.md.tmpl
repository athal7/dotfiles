# Agent Instructions

## Safety

**Confirm before modifying remote services.**

For any remote modification:
1. Show the full proposed content and ask "Do you approve?" - then STOP and wait
2. Only after receiving explicit "yes" or approval, execute the action
3. If no response is possible (background task, automation), do NOT proceed with the modification

This applies to:
- Git: `git push`
- GitHub/GitLab: issues, PRs, comments, **reviews**
- APIs that write/modify data
- Production databases
- Security bypasses: `.talismanrc` ignore rules (`fileignoreconfig`)

**Examples:**
- "Review this PR" → analyze and show review, but do NOT submit to GitHub without approval
- "Commit and push" → show diff and commit message, wait for approval before executing
- Background/automated tasks → analyze and prepare only, never submit

Even if the prompt implies end-to-end completion, always stop before remote modifications. Read-only operations don't require confirmation.

**Never commit globally-ignored files.** Files in `~/.config/git/ignore` are intentionally untracked. Before staging, verify files aren't globally ignored with `git check-ignore <file>`. Key examples: `.talismanrc`, `opencode.json`, `.opencode/context-log.md`.

## CLI Tools

The following tools are installed via Homebrew and available for use:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
{{- range (include ".chezmoitemplates/Brewfile" | splitList "\n") }}
{{-   if and (hasPrefix "brew " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "brew \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   else if and (hasPrefix "cask " .) (contains "#" .) }}
{{-     $parts := . | trimPrefix "cask \"" | splitList "\" # " }}
| `{{ index $parts 0 }}` | {{ index $parts 1 }} |
{{-   end }}
{{- end }}

**Prefer these tools** over alternatives when available. For example, use `bat` instead of `cat` for file preview, `jq` for JSON parsing, and `gh` for all GitHub operations.

## Tool Tips

**PTY** (when enabled) - for background processes:
- Send Ctrl+C with `\x03`, Ctrl+D with `\x04`
- Use regex filtering in `pty_read` to find errors: `pattern="error|ERROR"`

**GitHub PR Inline Comments** via `gh api`:
- Use `--input -` with heredoc JSON, not `-f 'comments=[...]'` (gets stringified, not parsed as array)
- Creating a review with comments returns PENDING state; must POST to `/reviews/{id}/events` with `event` to submit
- Line numbers are file lines in HEAD commit, but verify against GitHub's diff display - off-by-one errors are common
- To delete a comment: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id} --method DELETE`

## Task Completion

**Track progress with todos.** Before ending your response:
1. Ensure current work is saved (committed if applicable)
2. Update todo status to reflect actual progress
3. If workflow rules specify check-ins (e.g., "wait for approval"), follow them
4. Never abandon work silently—report status and next steps
