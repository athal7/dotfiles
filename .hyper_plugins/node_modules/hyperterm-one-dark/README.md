# One Dark for HyperTerm

[HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org) theme based on [@mdo's Hyperterm Atom Dark](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark). Hi was originally forked from @jxnblk's [HyperTerminator](https://github.com/jxnblk/hyperterminator).

### Install

1. Open HyperTerm's preferences with `Cmd+,` (or manually at `~/.hyperterm.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include `hyperterm-atom-dark`, like so:
  
  ```js
plugins: [
  'hyperterm-one-dark'
],
```
3. Fully reload HyperTerm (`Cmd+Shift+R`), and tada!
